# Quiz-App
Use this repository.
Clone it into your local PC.
Everytime you sit for working
do git pull,
then do git add .
then edit all your changes or adding files or removing them
then use git status to check that all are in green color
then do commit with a brief description in commit message
then pull the repo again and do git push.

Like this work collaboratively and make the app.
This is the kind of setting in proffesional work places.

HOPE THE APP COMES WELL.
